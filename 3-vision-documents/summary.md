# Apple's Vision Framework - Document Understanding

## Overview
Research and implementation of Apple's enhanced Vision framework capabilities for document understanding, introduced at WWDC 2025. Focus on leveraging VisionKit + Vision APIs to detect, extract, and process text from scanned documents, receipts, and forms directly on-device.

## Key Sessions & Resources
- WWDC 2025: "Read documents using the Vision framework"
- Apple Documentation: VisionKit Framework
- Apple Documentation: Vision Framework
- Sample Code: Document Scanner with Vision

## Key Takeaways

### New Capabilities
- Enhanced text detection and recognition accuracy
- Structured data extraction from documents
- Support for various document types (invoices, receipts, forms, IDs)
- On-device processing for privacy and performance
- Integration with VisionKit for seamless document capture

### API Highlights
- `VNRecognizeTextRequest` improvements
- `VNDetectDocumentSegmentationRequest` for document boundaries
- Enhanced `VNRecognizeDocumentElementsRequest` for structured content
- New text recognition languages and writing scripts

### Privacy & Performance Benefits
- All processing happens on-device
- No data sent to external servers
- Optimized for Apple Silicon
- Reduced latency compared to cloud solutions

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Invoice Processing
- Text extraction from invoice images
- Identification of key fields (vendor, amount, date, items)
- JSON structured output generation
- UI presentation of extracted data

### 2. Identity Document Reading
- ID card and passport text recognition
- Personal information extraction
- Document validation and verification
- Secure display of sensitive information

## Technical Considerations
- Memory management for large document processing
- Error handling for poor image quality
- Accessibility support for extracted content
- Localization for different document formats

## Real-World Use Cases
- Expense management applications
- Healthcare record digitization
- Legal document processing
- Financial services automation
- Educational record keeping
