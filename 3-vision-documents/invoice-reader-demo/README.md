# Invoice Reader Demo

## Overview
A minimal iOS app demonstrating Apple's Vision framework capabilities for extracting structured data from invoice images and displaying it in a formatted JSON structure.

## Features
- üì∏ Document camera integration for capturing invoice photos
- üñºÔ∏è Support for existing images from photo library
- üîç Text recognition and extraction using Vision framework
- üìä Structured data parsing (vendor, amount, date, line items)
- üì± Clean SwiftUI interface for displaying results
- üíæ JSON export functionality

## Key Components

### Vision Processing
- `InvoiceProcessor.swift` - Main Vision framework integration
- `TextExtractor.swift` - Text recognition and parsing logic
- `DataStructure.swift` - Invoice data models

### UI Components
- `CameraView.swift` - Document camera interface
- `ResultsView.swift` - Formatted JSON display
- `InvoiceDetailView.swift` - Structured data presentation

### Data Models
```swift
struct InvoiceData {
    let vendor: String?
    let amount: Decimal?
    let date: Date?
    let invoiceNumber: String?
    let lineItems: [LineItem]
}
```
