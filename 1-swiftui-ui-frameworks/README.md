# SwiftUI & UI Frameworks

## Overview
Latest SwiftUI updates, new UI components, and performance improvements from WWDC 2025, featuring the revolutionary "Liquid Glass" design system and major API enhancements.

## Key Topics
- **Liquid Glass Design System** - New adaptive material for controls and navigation
- **Performance Improvements** - 6x faster lists, new SwiftUI Performance Instrument
- **3D Layout and Spatial Computing** - New APIs for visionOS and spatial experiences
- **Cross-Platform Enhancements** - Scene bridging, improved RealityKit integration
- **New View Capabilities** - WebView, 3D Charts, enhanced drag and drop

## Demo Project Proposal: "ModernUI Explorer"

A comprehensive SwiftUI demo app that showcases all the new WWDC 2025 features:

### Core Features:
1. **Liquid Glass Showcase**
   - NavigationSplitView with floating Liquid Glass sidebar
   - TabView with floating tab bar and custom accessories
   - Custom Liquid Glass components using `glassEffect` modifier
   - Interactive glass effects and transitions

2. **Performance Demo**
   - Large lists demonstrating 6x performance improvement
   - SwiftUI Performance Instrument integration examples
   - Concurrent programming patterns

3. **3D and Spatial Features** (visionOS compatible)
   - 3D layout examples with Alignment3D
   - Manipulable objects with interactive controls
   - Chart3D implementation with sample data
   - Spatial overlay demonstrations

4. **Modern Controls Gallery**
   - Updated buttons with capsule shapes
   - Sliders with tick mark support
   - Enhanced menus with consistent iconography
   - Search experiences (toolbar and dedicated page patterns)

5. **Cross-Platform Integration**
   - Scene bridging examples
   - WebView with WebPage support
   - Rich text editing with AttributedString
   - Widget level of detail customization

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses new APIs: `@Animatable`, `DragConfiguration`, `LevelOfDetail`
- Demonstrates toolbar spacers, badges, and tinting
- Implements background extension effects
- Shows proper accessibility integration with Liquid Glass

### Learning Objectives:
- Master the Liquid Glass design system
- Understand performance optimizations
- Learn 3D layout and spatial computing APIs
- Practice cross-platform development patterns
- Explore new view capabilities and controls

This demo will serve as a reference implementation for adopting WWDC 2025 SwiftUI features in production apps.
